            For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with the
            question of our origins. Where do we come from and how did we get
            here?
          </p>
          <p class="exhibition-paragraphs">
            Since Darwin proposed his theory of evolution we have had a
            framework for exploring and understanding our place in this world.
          </p>
          <p class="exhibition-paragraphs">
          Discover the origins of life on this planet and how the species we
          know today have evolved our time. You can also take some time to meet
          a few of the creatures who didnâ€™t survive, including our Woolly
          Mammoth, the Dodos, and a number of dinosaurs too.</p>
